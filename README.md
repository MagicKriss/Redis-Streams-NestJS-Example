* [Part 1](https://hackernoon.com/using-redis-streams-with-nestjs-part-1-setup) - Setting up the NestJS application and connecting to Redis
* [Part 2](https://hackernoon.com/using-redis-streams-with-nestjs-part-2-reading-from-stream) - Populating Redis streams and reading from in **fan-out mode**
* Part 3 - Using **consumer groups** to handle one stream from multiple actors in a way that one message is sent to and processed only by a single actor (consumer)
