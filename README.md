# Redis Streams + NestJS

This is a supplimental code for a 3-part series, where we will explore how to use Redis streams with NestJS.


To see articles please go to:

* [Part 1](https://hackernoon.com/using-redis-streams-with-nestjs-part-1-setup) - Setting up the NestJS application and connecting to Redis
* Part 2 - Populating Redis streams and reading from in **fan-out mode**
* Part 3 - Using **consumer groups** to handle one stream from multiple actors in a way that one message is sent to and processed only by a single actor (consumer)


### TODOs
- [ ] Add links for pt2 and pt3 to README to posts when they come out
